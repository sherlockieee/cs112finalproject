# cs112finalproject

## Overview
The paper replicated and analyzed the data in Wilkus, Francesconi, Jager (2017). According to our analysis, the result can be more comprehensive through the use of better statistical tools. Our suggestions are: 
- To use Genetic Matching as an additional method to verify their findings for Unmatched Sample and Nearest Neighbor Matching. 
- To extend their existing study by performing a simulation and sensitivity analysis to gain more accurate results for both Genetic Matching and Nearest Neighbor Matching.
